# React Nanodegree UdaciCards Project

This project was built with React Native to create a mobile flashcard app for Android devices, using create-react-native-app to bootstrap the project. The app allows users to create decks of flashcards, which can hold an unlimited number of cards, add cards to decks, and quiz themselves on specific decks, receiving scores once they are done. Users also receive a notification to remind themselves to study if they have not already studied that day
